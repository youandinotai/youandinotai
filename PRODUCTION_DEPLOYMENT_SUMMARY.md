# YouAndINotAI - Production Deployment Summary

## Migration Completed: Stripe ‚Üí Square

### ‚úÖ What's Been Done

#### 1. **Payment Infrastructure Migration**
- **Removed**: All Stripe dependencies (`stripe`, `@stripe/stripe-js`, `@stripe/react-stripe-js`)
- **Added**: Square SDK (`square` package v43.1.1)
- **Result**: Complete payment processing now powered by Square

#### 2. **Database Schema Updates**
- Added `square_customer_id` column to `users` table
- Added `square_subscription_id` column to `users` and `subscriptions` tables
- Deprecated Stripe columns (kept for backward compatibility, can be removed later)

#### 3. **Backend API Changes**
- **Updated Routes**:
  - `POST /api/create-subscription` - Creates Square customer and processes payment
  - `POST /api/cancel-subscription` - Cancels Square payments
  - `GET /api/subscription-status` - Returns Square subscription data
  - `POST /api/webhooks/square` - **NEW** Webhook endpoint with signature verification

- **Security Features**:
  - ‚úÖ Client-generated stable transaction IDs for proper idempotency (prevents duplicate charges on retries)
  - ‚úÖ Webhook signature verification using raw request body and Square's WebhooksHelper
  - ‚úÖ Express raw body parsing for webhook routes to preserve signature integrity
  - ‚úÖ Environment-based configuration (production vs sandbox)
  - ‚úÖ SessionStorage-based transaction deduplication on frontend

- **Storage Interface**:
  - `updateUserSquareInfo()` - Stores Square customer and subscription IDs

#### 4. **Frontend Integration**
- **Rewritten**: `client/src/pages/subscribe.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Square Web Payments SDK integration
  - Card tokenization with secure payment form
  - Auto-switches between sandbox/production CDN based on environment
  - Proper error handling and UX feedback
  - Loading states during payment processing

#### 5. **Documentation Created**
- `SQUARE_MIGRATION.md` - Comprehensive migration guide
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` - This document
- Environment variable documentation
- Production checklist

## üîß Required Configuration

### Production Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` file with these **required** variables:

```bash
# Backend - Square API
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=EAAAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  # From Square Developer Dashboard
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY=sqwh_live_xxxxxxxxxx  # From Square Webhooks tab

# Frontend - Square Web Payments
VITE_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=sq0idp-xxxxxxxxxxxxxx  # From Square Credentials
VITE_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=LXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  # From Square Locations

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production

# Database (already configured)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

### How to Get Square Credentials

1. **Access Token** (Backend)
   - Go to: https://developer.squareup.com/
   - Select your application ‚Üí Credentials tab
   - Copy **Production Access Token**

2. **Application ID** (Frontend)
   - Same Credentials tab
   - Copy **Application ID**

3. **Location ID** (Frontend)
   - Go to: https://squareup.com/dashboard/
   - Navigate to Locations
   - Copy your Location ID

4. **Webhook Signature Key** (Backend)
   - Square Developer Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks tab
   - Create webhook pointing to: `https://youandinotai.com/api/webhooks/square`
   - Subscribe to events: `payment.*`, `subscription.*`
   - Copy the Signature Key

---

## üöÄ Production Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Update Environment Variables
```bash
# SSH into your server
ssh user@youandinotai.com

# Navigate to application directory
cd /path/to/youandinotai

# Edit .env file
nano .env

# Add all Square credentials (see above)
# Set NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 2: Apply Database Schema Changes
```bash
# Already applied via SQL ALTER TABLE commands
# Database now has square_customer_id and square_subscription_id columns

# Verify schema:
npm run db:push --force  # This will confirm schema is synced
```

### Step 3: Restart Application
```bash
# If using PM2 (recommended)
pm2 restart all
pm2 logs  # Verify no errors

# Or if using Docker
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Step 4: Configure Square Webhooks
1. Go to Square Developer Dashboard
2. Navigate to Webhooks tab
3. Click "Create Webhook"
4. Set URL: `https://youandinotai.com/api/webhooks/square`
5. Subscribe to events:
   - `payment.created`
   - `payment.updated`
   - `subscription.created`
   - `subscription.updated`
   - `subscription.canceled`
6. Save and copy the Signature Key
7. Update `.env` with `SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY`
8. Restart application

### Step 5: Test Payment Flow
1. Navigate to: `https://youandinotai.com/subscribe`
2. Use a real credit card (or Square test cards in sandbox)
3. Complete payment
4. Verify:
   - Payment appears in Square Dashboard
   - User's `isPremium` status is updated
   - `square_customer_id` and `square_subscription_id` are stored
   - Webhook events are received and logged

---

## üîí Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- Webhook signature verification using Square's HMAC-SHA256 with raw request body
- Express raw body parser specifically for webhook routes
- Client-generated stable transaction IDs for idempotency (prevents double-charges on retries)
- SessionStorage-based transaction deduplication
- Environment-based configuration (no hardcoded credentials)
- Secure card tokenization via Square Web Payments SDK (card data never touches your servers)
- HTTPS required for production (already configured)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Never** commit `.env` file to version control
- Production access token should only be used on production server
- Rotate webhook signature key if compromised
- Monitor webhook logs for invalid signatures

---

## üìä Current Subscription Model

**Pricing**: $9.99/week

**Implementation**: One-time weekly payments
- When user subscribes, a $9.99 payment is charged immediately
- Client generates a stable UUID transaction ID (stored in sessionStorage)
- Transaction ID is sent to backend and used as idempotency key
- Payment ID is stored as `square_subscription_id`
- User's `isPremium` flag is set to `true`
- Duplicate submissions with same transaction ID are prevented by Square's idempotency

**Important Note**: This is a one-time payment implementation, not automatic recurring billing.

**Future Enhancement for True Subscriptions** (Optional):
For automatic recurring subscriptions, implement:
1. Square Subscriptions API (requires catalog/subscription plan setup in Square Dashboard)
2. Create subscription instead of one-time payment in create-subscription endpoint
3. Use subscriptionsApi.cancelSubscription() in cancel-subscription endpoint
4. Handle subscription.updated webhooks for automatic renewals
5. Track subscription periods and renewal dates

- [ ] Test payment with sandbox test cards
- [ ] Verify webhook events in dev environment

### Production Testing

## üîç Monitoring & Logs

### Key Logs to Monitor
```bash
# Application logs (PM2)
pm2 logs youandinotai

# Look for:
- "SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN not found" (should NOT appear in production)
- "Square webhook event received: payment.created"
- "Payment completed for customer: CUST_ID"
- Any webhook signature errors
```

### Square Dashboard
- Monitor payments: https://squareup.com/dashboard/sales/transactions
- Check webhook deliveries: https://developer.squareup.com/ ‚Üí Webhooks
- Review failed webhook attempts and retry them

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Payment Not Processing
1. Check console logs for Square SDK errors
2. Verify `VITE_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID` and `VITE_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID`
3. Ensure production credentials (not sandbox) are used
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Webhook Not Receiving Events
1. Verify webhook URL is publicly accessible
2. Check webhook signature key matches
3. Review Square Developer Dashboard for webhook delivery status
4. Check application logs for signature verification errors

### User Not Upgraded to Premium
1. Check if payment was successful in Square Dashboard
2. Verify `square_customer_id` and `square_subscription_id` in database
3. Check `isPremium` flag in `users` table
4. Review webhook event processing logs

---

## üìù Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

1. **Recurring Subscriptions**: Implement Square Subscriptions API for automatic renewals
2. **Database Cleanup**: Remove deprecated Stripe columns after confirming all data migrated
3. **Analytics**: Add payment success/failure tracking
4. **Admin Panel**: Build dashboard to monitor subscriptions
5. **Email Notifications**: Send payment confirmations and renewal reminders
